A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps
the Website to remember information about your visit. That can make your next visit
easier and the site more useful to you.<br>
We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains
after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on
subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following

In addition, we work with reputable companies who can use their cookies when you

count how many visitors we receive to a page, to help us analyze how the Website is
used (e.g. Google Analytics cookies). We use the information to compile reports and
to help us improve the Website. The cookies collect information in an anonymous
form, including the number of visitors to the Website, where visitors have come to
the Website from and the pages they visited.<br>
Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings.

Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they
visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website.<br>
We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website.<br>
Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit
this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine
the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal

be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information

only first-party cookies for data analysis. This means that the cookies are linked to a
specific website domain, and Google Analytics will only use that cookie data for
statistical analysis related to your browsing behavior on that specific website.<br>
According to Google, the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services
from other domains.<br>
